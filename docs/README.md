## Project Overview

The LLM Query Understanding Service is a lightweight API that transforms natural language furniture queries into structured JSON data using a small, efficient Large Language Model (Qwen2-0.5B-Instruct).

Example transformation:
```
"blue wooden dining table" â†’ {"item_type": "dining table", "material": "wooden", "color": "blue"}
```

This service is designed for integration with e-commerce search systems, catalog management tools, and other applications requiring natural language understanding for furniture queries.
